Few evaluation points:

- Loging in ScaleApp is empty, you need to add Plugin to core for that. (-)
- Existing plugins are in coffeescript. (-)
- Documenation is not very detailed. (-)
+ Plugin suppport for core (i18n, permission, statemachine, etc.) (+)
+ Can define custom sandbox including properties from default sandbox. (+)
+ Works well in module lifecycle managment. (+)
- ScaleApp is not mature enough, few versions and few commits. (-)
- ScaleApp community is not that active. (-)
